# Prime-C for HP Prime
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Insoft-UK/Prime-C/main/assets/Prime-C_Logo.svg" style="width: 128px" />
Prime-C is a high-level general-purpose programming language that adds some elements of C to the PPL programming language.
<br />
<br />
This experimental project is expected to undergo significant evolution as development continues. Its primary aim is to assess the feasibility of creating a hybrid language combining PPL and C-like syntax, allowing developers to write code in a unified environment. The language is designed to compile directly into pure PPL for the HP Prime calculator, while also supporting compilation for platforms like macOS. This enables users to test and debug their code natively before deploying it on an actual HP Prime calculator.

>[!WARNING]
Experimental, not intended to be used for actual software development.

>[!NOTE]
When compiling for macOS, the project will use a C++ library to emulate PPL functions. A Xcode SpriteKit based macOS app is utilized to simulate the HP Prime environment to a certain degree, allowing one to easly test and debug an HP Prime app written in Prime-C to a certain degree.
