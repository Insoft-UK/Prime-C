Prime-C is a Compiler for a C-like language that translates code into PPL (Prime Programming Language) for the HP Prime calculator.

This project is experimental and will see significant changes as development progresses. The aim is to investigate whether it's feasible to create a C-like language that allows code to be written in this form of C, with the ability to compile it into PPL (Prime Programming Language) for the HP Prime calculator, while also enabling the same codebase to compile for macOS.

>[!WARNING]
Experimental, not to be used software development.

>[!NOTE]
When compiling for macOS, Windows, or Linux, the project will use a C++ library to emulate PPL functions. SDL2 will be utilized to create a simulator for the HP Prime environment, allowing the same codebase to run on these platforms.
