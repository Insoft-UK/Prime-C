# Prime-C
Prime-C is a compiler for a C-like language that translates code into PPL (Prime Programming Language) for the HP Prime calculator.

This project is experimental and will see significant changes as development progresses. The aim is to investigate whether it's feasible to create a C-like language that allows code to be written in this form of C, with the ability to compile it into PPL (Prime Programming Language) for the HP Prime calculator, while also enabling the same codebase to compile for macOS.
